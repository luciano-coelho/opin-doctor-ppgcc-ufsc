## mTLS handshake vs. OPIN processing time (gateway-side)

Requests logged by the gateway in this run: **38**

| Phase | Requests | Mean (ms) | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mTLS handshake | 6 | 105 | 98.5 | 129.75 | 135.55 |
| OPIN processing | 38 | 101.95 | 59.0 | 327.4 | 449.99 |

Note: for keep-alive connections, only the first request on a given connection pays the handshake cost -- every subsequent request on that same connection reports the same (already-past) handshake timestamps, which is expected.
0 handshake duration sample(s) discarded as outliers (> 3x this scenario's median; see filter_handshake_outliers).

### mTLS handshake size (wire bytes)

Total bytes read+written at the raw TCP level during the handshake (ClientHello through Finished), counted below crypto/tls so it captures the actual negotiated messages regardless of algorithm -- see countingConn in mock-service-os/mock_mtls/main.go. This is the number expected to grow substantially under PQC (larger KEM public keys/ciphertexts and signatures), unlike clientCertBytes above which is only one certificate.

| Requests | Mean (bytes) | P50 (bytes) | P95 (bytes) | P99 (bytes) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 9969.5 | 9785.0 | 10407.25 | 10414.25 |

0 handshake byte-size sample(s) discarded as outliers (same filter/reasoning as the duration outliers above).

## Bytes by participant

**Client** is the Conformance Suite itself (the OPIN client in this test harness) -- it is one of the two parties on every call this table is built from, so its sent+received always equals the scenario's total bytes exchanged by construction, not a measurement of a separate category. AS/RS/Directory/PKI-CRL are the actual breakdown: who specifically the client was talking to on each call, and they sum to the same total.

| Participant | Sent (bytes) | Received (bytes) | Total (bytes) |
|---|---|---|---|
| AS | 14188 | 11875 | 26063 |
| Client (test tool, total traffic) | 17378 | 50228 | 67606 |
| PKI/CRL | 10006 | 664 | 10670 |
| RS | 26034 | 4839 | 30873 |
