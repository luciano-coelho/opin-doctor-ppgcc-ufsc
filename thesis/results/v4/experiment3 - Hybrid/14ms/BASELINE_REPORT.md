## mTLS handshake vs. OPIN processing time (gateway-side)

Requests logged by the gateway in this run: **38**

| Phase | Requests | Mean (ms) | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mTLS handshake | 6 | 60.17 | 63.0 | 68.5 | 68.9 |
| OPIN processing | 38 | 73.32 | 37.0 | 252.65 | 401.21 |

Note: for keep-alive connections, only the first request on a given connection pays the handshake cost -- every subsequent request on that same connection reports the same (already-past) handshake timestamps, which is expected.
0 handshake duration sample(s) discarded as outliers (> 3x this scenario's median; see filter_handshake_outliers).

### mTLS handshake size (wire bytes)

Total bytes read+written at the raw TCP level during the handshake (ClientHello through Finished), counted below crypto/tls so it captures the actual negotiated messages regardless of algorithm -- see countingConn in mock-service-os/mock_mtls/main.go. This is the number expected to grow substantially under PQC (larger KEM public keys/ciphertexts and signatures), unlike clientCertBytes above which is only one certificate.

| Requests | Mean (bytes) | P50 (bytes) | P95 (bytes) | P99 (bytes) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 25997.67 | 25880.0 | 26402.0 | 26489.2 |

0 handshake byte-size sample(s) discarded as outliers (same filter/reasoning as the duration outliers above).

## Bytes by participant

**Client** is the Conformance Suite itself (the OPIN client in this test harness) -- it is one of the two parties on every call this table is built from, so its sent+received always equals the scenario's total bytes exchanged by construction, not a measurement of a separate category. AS/RS/Directory/PKI-CRL are the actual breakdown: who specifically the client was talking to on each call, and they sum to the same total.

| Participant | Sent (bytes) | Received (bytes) | Total (bytes) |
|---|---|---|---|
| AS | 31058 | 47173 | 78231 |
| Client (test tool, total traffic) | 52676 | 166062 | 218738 |
| PKI/CRL | 37768 | 664 | 38432 |
| RS | 97236 | 4839 | 102075 |
